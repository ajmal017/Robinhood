## Login/Logout
### Login
``` Robinhood ``` implementation: ``` login() ```  
``` Client ``` implementation: ``` login(username, password) ```  
Robinhood uses a token system. Each request to an account's private information needs to include the token in the header.  
The token is represented in the header as ``` Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN] ```  
To obtain the token make a ``` POST ``` request to ``` https://api.robinhood.com/oauth2/token/ ``` with the following content:  
```json
{
    "grant_type":"password",
    "scope":"internal",
    "client_id":"c82SH0WZOsabOXGP2sxqcj34FxkvfnWRZBKlBjFS",
    "expires_in":86400,
    "device_token":"device_token",
    "username":"username",
    "password":"password"
}
```  
The ``` device_token ``` is generated by the Robinhood javascript or in the smartphone app.  Details of which were not clear.  
  
Robinhood will reply with the following content:
```json
{
    "access_token": "[LONG TOKEN]",
    "expires_in": 86400,
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "internal",
    "refresh_token": "[short token]",
    "mfa_code": null,
    "backup_code": null
}
```
## Logout
``` Robinhood ``` implementation: ``` logout() ```  
``` Client ``` implementation: ``` logout() ```  
Logging out is straightforward. In the header include the ``` Authorization ``` token, and the body will include the refresh token.  
Make a ``` POST ``` request to ``` https://api.robinhood.com/oauth2/revoke_token/ ``` with the following content:
```json
{
    "client_id":"c82SH0WZOsabOXGP2sxqcj34FxkvfnWRZBKlBjFS",
    "token":"refresh_token"
}
```
At this point the server will return a 200 error code with no content.
## Account Info
``` Client ``` implementation: ``` account_info() ```  
Requires user login (Authorization token). The request is made to Robinhood and returns general account info.  
A ``` GET ``` request is made to ``` https://api.robinhood.com/accounts/ ```. The server will respond with the following:  
```json
